       ;; what makes a good notation:
       ;; 1) concision 2) practical 3) makes the important obvious 4) creates the right mental model via appropriate representations / abstractions.
       ;; current notation: uselessly (IMHO) centered around one scale instead of making the deep symmetries of music apparent
       ;;
       ;; The history of other fields show that the notation has a crucial impact on the reach of our thought.
       ;; (examples: Arab vs Roman numbers, math equations, programming languages)
       ;;
       ;; So what *is* important when interpreting music notations? Boils down to a few questions:
       ;; 1. Given a note, where does it fit on the scale ?
       ;; 2. Given a set of notes (a chord, a scale, a musical phrase...), what are the intervals by which these notes are related ?
       ;; 3. Given a base note, what is the note that is at some interval of this note ?
       ;;
       ;; Some notations are especially bad at this. For example, a guitar tab doesn't help you answer question 1 at all.
       ;;
       ;; But once you represent notes and intervals as numbers, you realize that answering those questions translates to very basic
       ;; mental caculations, like addition and subtraction. Here are some examples:
       ;; TODO Table english formulation vs number formulation.
       ;; This is where the notation can help you: by using a few mental caculation tricks, you can build a mental map of music
       ;; much faster than if you just learned by heart the intervals between every pair of notes. Cf the "counting with notes" section below.

    [:h3 "Scale notes"
     ;; explanation: in many respects, notes that are exactly one our several octaves (12 half-tones) apart
     ;; can be considered the same, e.g a Sol4 is considered the same as a Sol5, and we just call it a 'Sol'.
     ;; In M12 notation, instead of writing it 47 or 57, we just write it 7.
     ;; Likewise, an interval of 3 half-tones is considered the same as an interval of 15 half-tones or an interval of
     ;; -9 half-tones, and we call it a 'minor 3rd'. In M12 notation, we write it 3.

     ;; We call the 12 notes in this cycle the *scale notes*.

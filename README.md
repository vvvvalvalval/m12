A project experimenting with 12-digits notation for music.

Set up with the [devcards](https://github.com/bhauman/devcards) leiningen template.
Adapted to use the Figwheel REPL in combination with the Cursive IDE.

Currently uses [AudioSynth](https://github.com/keithwhor/audiosynth) for playing music in the browser.

## TODO

* LESS instead of CSS, allow for putting style files in src/
* Netlify deploy

## Caveats

the script for watching less files is a bit hacky.
